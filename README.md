# Fortanix Plugin Library

It is the common scenario that some of the customers requirements involve
executing a custom set of cryptographic operations that are tied to the
specific business logic. As an example, clients that are developing/using HD
wallets for cryptocurrencies applications make use of a standard algorithm
known as BIP32 to derive public keys. In order to bring an extra level of
flexibility to customers, SDKMS offers "plugins" to allow them to run custom
code securely inside enclaves and make use of their security objects.

Plugins are can be written and loaded by customers to SDKMS. Currently, the
LUA language is supported.

Given the tremendous success and flexibility that plugins provide, Fortanix is
releasing a plugin library so that as soon as customers start using SDKMS they
have access to a menu of different tested common case plugins.

Plugin Libraries are Git repositories that contain custom code (plugins) that
can be executed inside SDKMS to achieve certain functionality that is not part
of the core capabilities offered by SDKMS.
